# TicketMachine
This is a console-based program, which I collaboratively worked on with two of my classmates as part of our project for AP Computer Science Principles. It replicates a cinema ticket machine, which 
allows you to choose free seats by randomly marking the taken seats. In the end, it gives a "printed" receipt of the purchased tickets including information about the seats. 
We used C# as the programming language of the program.
